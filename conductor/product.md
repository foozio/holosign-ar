# Initial Concept
A browser-based augmented reality 3D ASL hand-gesture interpreter using YOLOv8, MediaPipe Hands, and Three.js.

# Product Definition

## Vision
To provide an accessible, high-performance, real-time tool for interpreting and learning American Sign Language (ASL) through a web browser using augmented reality and state-of-the-art object detection.

## Core Features
- **Real-time Hand Tracking**: High-performance detection of hand landmarks and gesture-based object detection using YOLOv8.
- **3D Skeleton Overlay**: Immersive visualization of hand gestures in AR.
- **Static & Dynamic ASL Recognition**: Interpreting both fixed poses and complex hand movements with an expanded vocabulary of 100+ signs.
- **Interpret Mode**: Live captioning of signs with confidence levels.
- **Learn Mode**: Interactive platform for users to practice and receive feedback on their ASL skills.

## Target Audience
- Individuals interested in learning ASL.
- Developers looking for a foundation in AR and hand-gesture recognition.
- Educators seeking tools for remote sign language instruction.

## Success Criteria
- High accuracy in recognizing a broad vocabulary of signs.
- Smooth, low-latency 3D rendering and tracking performance.
- Intuitive user interface for both interpreting and learning modes.
