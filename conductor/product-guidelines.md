# Product Guidelines

## Visual Identity & UX Style
- **Cyberpunk Aesthetic:** Utilize a "high-tech, low-life" visual style. This includes dark backgrounds contrasted with neon accents (cyan, magenta, electric lime).
- **Glowing Overlays:** The 3D hand skeleton and gesture indicators should have a soft glow effect to simulate holographic projections.
- **Digital HUD:** The user interface should resemble a futuristic Heads-Up Display (HUD), using monospaced or geometric fonts and thin-line borders.
- **Immersive Feedback:** Use subtle animations and transitions that evoke a digital "glitch" or "scanline" effect when new gestures are detected.

## Brand Messaging & Tone
- **Innovative & Cutting-Edge:** Position HoloSign AR as the future of human-computer interaction. Use language that is forward-looking and exciting.
- **Empowering:** Communicate that the user is mastering a new way of interacting with the digital world through their physical gestures.
- **Direct & Efficient:** The tone should be sharp and concise, mirroring the speed and precision of the underlying technology.

## Design Principles
- **Performance First:** Visual effects should never compromise the real-time responsiveness of hand tracking.
- **Clarity in Chaos:** Despite the futuristic aesthetic, critical information (like interpreted text) must remain highly legible.
- **On-Device Pride:** Explicitly mention that all "bio-data" (hand tracking) is processed locally, reinforcing the security of the user's "digital self."
