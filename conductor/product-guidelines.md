**Professional & Utility-Focused**
- The UI will prioritize efficiency and information density.
- Layouts will be structured to provide quick access to tools and recognition data without clutter.
- A consistent, high-contrast color scheme will be used to ensure legibility of text and 3D elements.

## User Experience (UX) Principles
- **Gamification:** The learning experience will be enhanced with progress tracking, achievement milestones, and skill leveling to motivate continuous engagement.
- **Multi-modal Learning:** Educational content will be presented through a synthesis of 3D AR overlays, video references, and clear textual descriptions to cater to different learning styles.
- **Feedback Loops:** Clear, immediate feedback will be provided during practice sessions, leveraging the 3D visualization to highlight accuracy.
